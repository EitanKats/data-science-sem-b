# Data science project semester B :mechanical_arm:

## General overview of the repository:

This project consists of 4 notebooks:

1. Classification improvement from semester A

In this semester we talked about ensemble learning, can we use the new ensemble learning methods to improve the word we have done in the previous semester ? 

2. Fashion mnist (without neural networks)

In this task we had to tackle the Fashion mnist dataset, we had to use the methods that were taught in the first year which means no neural networks.
tools like : ensemble, PCA, Kmeans, were viable

3. Cats Vs Dogs (without neural networks) :cat:	 :dog:
